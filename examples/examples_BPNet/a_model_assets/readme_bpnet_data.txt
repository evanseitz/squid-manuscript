BPNET:
If not using Zenodo archive (10.5281/zenodo.10047748), save bpnet_seqs_chr1-8-9.h5 and bpnet_deeplift_chr1-8-9.h5 via the links below and move it to the current directory.

DeepLIFT:
The file 'deeplift.imp_score.h5' is automatically generated during retraining model, with instructions for doing so available at:
https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet-manuscript/bpnet-manuscript-data/output/nexus,peaks,OSNK,0,10,1,FALSE,same,0.5,64,25,0.004,9,FALSE,[1,50],TRUE/)

Once 'deeplift.imp_score.h5' is moved into this folder, run SQUID/examples/testing/testing_model_BPNet.py to reproduce the subset of DeepLIFT scores (for test set) used in the SQUID analysis: i.e., bpnet_deeplift_chr1-8-9.h5
