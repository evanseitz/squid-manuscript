This repository reproduces the analysis performed in our manuscript **Identifying *cis*-regulatory mechanisms from genomic deep neural networks using surrogate models** (Seitz, McCandlish, Kinney and Koo). It contains tools to apply the discussed method **SQUID** (**S**urrogate **Qu**antitative **I**nterpretability for **D**eepnets) on genomic models.

## Usage:
The `/examples` directory contains example code for running SQUID on several deep-learning models. Within that directory, we have supplied additional README material for setting up environments and initializing our workflow. As well, detailed instructions and comments for all procedures are provided in the code.

The release of this repository is also available via [Zenodo](doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10047747), with the addition that all intermediate and final outputs are provided there.
